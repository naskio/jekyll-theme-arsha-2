# The empty front matter at the top tells Jekyll it needs to process the file (for dynamic url resolution).
# Dynamic content should be in assets/ folder (in files with a Front-Matter) so it can be processed by Jekyll
# This file isn't being used now, it can be deleted (content moved to ./sass.scss)
