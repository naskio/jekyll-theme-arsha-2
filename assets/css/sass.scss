# this ensures Jekyll reads the file to be transformed into CSS later
# only Main files contain this front matter, not partials.

# The empty front matter at the top tells Jekyll it needs to process the file (needed for loading SASS).
# This file is used to load all SASS files.
# We can use Liquid here to addded dynamic content to SASS files.
